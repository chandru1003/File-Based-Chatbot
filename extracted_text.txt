THE 1ST LAW
Make It Obvious4
The Man Who Didn’t Look Right
THE PSYCHOLOGIST GARY Klein once told me a story about a woman who
attended a family gathering. She had spent years working as a
paramedic and, upon arriving at the event, took one look at her father-
in-law and got very concerned.
“I don’t like the way you look,” she said.
Her father-in-law, who was feeling perfectly fine, jokingly replied,
“Well, I don’t like your looks, either.”
“No,” she insisted. “You need to go to the hospital now.”
A few hours later, the man was undergoing lifesaving surgery after
an examination had revealed that he had a blockage to a major artery
and was at immediate risk of a heart attack. Without his daughter-in-
law’s intuition, he could have died.
What did the paramedic see? How did she predict his impending
heart attack?
When major arteries are obstructed, the body focuses on sending
blood to critical organs and away from peripheral locations near the
surface of the skin. The result is a change in the pattern of distribution
of blood in the face. After many years of working with people with
heart failure, the woman had unknowingly developed the ability to
recognize this pattern on sight. She couldn’t explain what it was that
she noticed in her father-in-law’s face, but she knew something was
wrong.
Similar stories exist in other fields. For example, military analysts
can identify which blip on a radar screen is an enemy missile andwhich one is a plane from their own fleet even though they are
traveling at the same speed, flying at the same altitude, and look
identical on radar in nearly every respect. During the Gulf War,
Lieutenant Commander Michael Riley saved an entire battleship when
he ordered a missile shot down—despite the fact that it looked exactly
like the battleship’s own planes on radar. He made the right call, but
even his superior officers couldn’t explain how he did it.
Museum curators have been known to discern the difference
between an authentic piece of art and an expertly produced counterfeit
even though they can’t tell you precisely which details tipped them off.
Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan and predict the area
where a stroke will develop before any obvious signs are visible to the
untrained eye. I’ve even heard of hairdressers noticing whether a client
is pregnant based only on the feel of her hair.
The human brain is a prediction machine. It is continuously taking
in your surroundings and analyzing the information it comes across.
Whenever you experience something repeatedly—like a paramedic
seeing the face of a heart attack patient or a military analyst seeing a
missile on a radar screen—your brain begins noticing what is
important, sorting through the details and highlighting the relevant
cues, and cataloging that information for future use.
With enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict
certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it. Automatically,
your brain encodes the lessons learned through experience. We can’t
always explain what it is we are learning, but learning is happening all
along the way, and your ability to notice the relevant cues in a given
situation is the foundation for every habit you have.
We underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without
thinking. You do not tell your hair to grow, your heart to pump, your
lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. And yet your body handles
all this and more on autopilot. You are much more than your conscious
self.
Consider hunger. How do you know when you’re hungry? You don’t
necessarily have to see a cookie on the counter to realize that it is time
to eat. Appetite and hunger are governed nonconsciously. Your body
has a variety of feedback loops that gradually alert you when it is time
to eat again and that track what is going on around you and within you.
Cravings can arise thanks to hormones and chemicals circulatingthrough your body. Suddenly, you’re hungry even though you’re not
quite sure what tipped you off.
This is one of the most surprising insights about our habits: you
don’t need to be aware of the cue for a habit to begin. You can notice an
opportunity and take action without dedicating conscious attention to
it. This is what makes habits useful.
It’s also what makes them dangerous. As habits form, your actions
come under the direction of your automatic and nonconscious mind.
You fall into old patterns before you realize what’s happening. Unless
someone points it out, you may not notice that you cover your mouth
with your hand whenever you laugh, that you apologize before asking a
question, or that you have a habit of finishing other people’s sentences.
And the more you repeat these patterns, the less likely you become to
question what you’re doing and why you’re doing it.
I once heard of a retail clerk who was instructed to cut up empty gift
cards after customers had used up the balance on the card. One day,
the clerk cashed out a few customers in a row who purchased with gift
cards. When the next person walked up, the clerk swiped the
customer’s actual credit card, picked up the scissors, and then cut it in
half—entirely on autopilot—before looking up at the stunned customer
and realizing what had just happened.
Another woman I came across in my research was a former
preschool teacher who had switched to a corporate job. Even though
she was now working with adults, her old habits would kick in and she
kept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands after going to the
bathroom. I also found the story of a man who had spent years
working as a lifeguard and would occasionally yell “Walk!” whenever
he saw a child running.
Over time, the cues that spark our habits become so common that
they are essentially invisible: the treats on the kitchen counter, the
remote control next to the couch, the phone in our pocket. Our
responses to these cues are so deeply encoded that it may feel like the
urge to act comes from nowhere. For this reason, we must begin the
process of behavior change with awareness.
Before we can effectively build new habits, we need to get a handle
on our current ones. This can be more challenging than it sounds
because once a habit is firmly rooted in your life, it is mostlynonconscious and automatic. If a habit remains mindless, you can’t
expect to improve it. As the psychologist Carl Jung said, “Until you
make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will
call it fate.”
THE HABITS SCORECARD
The Japanese railway system is regarded as one of the best in the
world. If you ever find yourself riding a train in Tokyo, you’ll notice
that the conductors have a peculiar habit.
As each operator runs the train, they proceed through a ritual of
pointing at different objects and calling out commands. When the train
approaches a signal, the operator will point at it and say, “Signal is
green.” As the train pulls into and out of each station, the operator will
point at the speedometer and call out the exact speed. When it’s time
to leave, the operator will point at the timetable and state the time. Out
on the platform, other employees are performing similar actions.
Before each train departs, staff members will point along the edge of
the platform and declare, “All clear!” Every detail is identified, pointed
at, and named aloud.*
This process, known as Pointing-and-Calling, is a safety system
designed to reduce mistakes. It seems silly, but it works incredibly
well. Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors by up to 85 percent and cuts
accidents by 30 percent. The MTA subway system in New York City
adopted a modified version that is “point-only,” and “within two years
of implementation, incidents of incorrectly berthed subways fell 57
percent.”
Pointing-and-Calling is so effective because it raises the level of
awareness from a nonconscious habit to a more conscious level.
Because the train operators must use their eyes, hands, mouth, and
ears, they are more likely to notice problems before something goes
wrong.
My wife does something similar. Whenever we are preparing to
walk out the door for a trip, she verbally calls out the most essential
items in her packing list. “I’ve got my keys. I’ve got my wallet. I’ve got
my glasses. I’ve got my husband.”The more automatic a behavior becomes, the less likely we are to
consciously think about it. And when we’ve done something a
thousand times before, we begin to overlook things. We assume that
the next time will be just like the last. We’re so used to doing what
we’ve always done that we don’t stop to question whether it’s the right
thing to do at all. Many of our failures in performance are largely
attributable to a lack of self-awareness.
One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining
awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the
consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-
call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits
Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more
aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily
habits.
Here’s a sample of where your list might start:
Wake up
Turn off alarm
Check my phone
Go to the bathroom
Weigh myself
Take a shower
Brush my teeth
Floss my teeth
Put on deodorant
Hang up towel to dry
Get dressed
Make a cup of tea
. . . and so on.
Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is
this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit,
write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit,
write “=”.For example, the list above might look like this:
Wake up =
Turn off alarm =
Check my phone –
Go to the bathroom =
Weigh myself +
Take a shower +
Brush my teeth +
Floss my teeth +
Put on deodorant +
Hang up towel to dry =
Get dressed =
Make a cup of tea +
The marks you give to a particular habit will depend on your
situation and your goals. For someone who is trying to lose weight,
eating a bagel with peanut butter every morning might be a bad habit.
For someone who is trying to bulk up and add muscle, the same
behavior might be a good habit. It all depends on what you’re working
toward.*
Scoring your habits can be a bit more complex for another reason as
well. The labels “good habit” and “bad habit” are slightly inaccurate.
There are no good habits or bad habits. There are only effective habits.
That is, effective at solving problems. All habits serve you in some way
—even the bad ones—which is why you repeat them. For this exercise,
categorize your habits by how they will benefit you in the long run.
Generally speaking, good habits will have net positive outcomes. Bad
habits have net negative outcomes. Smoking a cigarette may reduce
stress right now (that’s how it’s serving you), but it’s not a healthy
long-term behavior.
If you’re still having trouble determining how to rate a particular
habit, here is a question I like to use: “Does this behavior help me
become the type of person I wish to be? Does this habit cast a vote foror against my desired identity?” Habits that reinforce your desired
identity are usually good. Habits that conflict with your desired
identity are usually bad.
As you create your Habits Scorecard, there is no need to change
anything at first. The goal is to simply notice what is actually going on.
Observe your thoughts and actions without judgment or internal
criticism. Don’t blame yourself for your faults. Don’t praise yourself for
your successes.
If you eat a chocolate bar every morning, acknowledge it, almost as
if you were watching someone else. Oh, how interesting that they
would do such a thing. If you binge-eat, simply notice that you are
eating more calories than you should. If you waste time online, notice
that you are spending your life in a way that you do not want to.
The first step to changing bad habits is to be on the lookout for
them. If you feel like you need extra help, then you can try Pointing-
and-Calling in your own life. Say out loud the action that you are
thinking of taking and what the outcome will be. If you want to cut
back on your junk food habit but notice yourself grabbing another
cookie, say out loud, “I’m about to eat this cookie, but I don’t need it.
Eating it will cause me to gain weight and hurt my health.”
Hearing your bad habits spoken aloud makes the consequences
seem more real. It adds weight to the action rather than letting
yourself mindlessly slip into an old routine. This approach is useful
even if you’re simply trying to remember a task on your to-do list. Just
saying out loud, “Tomorrow, I need to go to the post office after lunch,”
increases the odds that you’ll actually do it. You’re getting yourself to
acknowledge the need for action—and that can make all the difference.
The process of behavior change always starts with awareness.
Strategies like Pointing-and-Calling and the Habits Scorecard are
focused on getting you to recognize your habits and acknowledge the
cues that trigger them, which makes it possible to respond in a way
that benefits you.
Chapter Summary
With enough practice, your brain will pick up on the cues that
predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it.Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to
what we are doing.
The process of behavior change always starts with awareness. You
need to be aware of your habits before you can change them.
Pointing-and-Calling raises your level of awareness from a
nonconscious habit to a more conscious level by verbalizing your
actions.
The Habits Scorecard is a simple exercise you can use to become
more aware of your behavior.5
The Best Way to Start a New Habit
I
N 2001, RESEARCHERS in Great Britain began working with 248 people
to build better exercise habits over the course of two weeks. The
subjects were divided into three groups.
The first group was the control group. They were simply asked to
track how often they exercised.
The second group was the “motivation” group. They were asked not
only to track their workouts but also to read some material on the
benefits of exercise. The researchers also explained to the group how
exercise could reduce the risk of coronary heart disease and improve
heart health.
Finally, there was the third group. These subjects received the same
presentation as the second group, which ensured that they had equal
levels of motivation. However, they were also asked to formulate a plan
for when and where they would exercise over the following week.
Specifically, each member of the third group completed the following
sentence: “During the next week, I will partake in at least 20 minutes
of vigorous exercise on [DAY] at [TIME] in [PLACE].”
In the first and second groups, 35 to 38 percent of people exercised
at least once per week. (Interestingly, the motivational presentation
given to the second group seemed to have no meaningful impact on
behavior.) But 91 percent of the third group exercised at least once per
week—more than double the normal rate.
The sentence they filled out is what researchers refer to as an
implementation intention, which is a plan you make beforehand aboutwhen and where to act. That is, how you intend to implement a
particular habit.
The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the
feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip
cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common
cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of
these cues.
Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation
intention is:
“When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
Hundreds of studies have shown that implementation intentions are
effective for sticking to our goals, whether it’s writing down the exact
time and date of when you will get a flu shot or recording the time of
your colonoscopy appointment. They increase the odds that people will
stick with habits like recycling, studying, going to sleep early, and
stopping smoking.
Researchers have even found that voter turnout increases when
people are forced to create implementation intentions by answering
questions like: “What route are you taking to the polling station? At
what time are you planning to go? What bus will get you there?” Other
successful government programs have prompted citizens to make a
clear plan to send taxes in on time or provided directions on when and
where to pay late traffic bills.
The punch line is clear: people who make a specific plan for when
and where they will perform a new habit are more likely to follow
through. Too many people try to change their habits without these
basic details figured out. We tell ourselves, “I’m going to eat healthier”
or “I’m going to write more,” but we never say when and where these
habits are going to happen. We leave it up to chance and hope that we
will “just remember to do it” or feel motivated at the right time. An
implementation intention sweeps away foggy notions like “I want to
work out more” or “I want to be more productive” or “I should vote”
and transforms them into a concrete plan of action.
Many people think they lack motivation when what they really lack
is clarity. It is not always obvious when and where to take action. Some
people spend their entire lives waiting for the time to be right to make
an improvement.Once an implementation intention has been set, you don’t have to
wait for inspiration to strike. Do I write a chapter today or not? Do I
meditate this morning or at lunch? When the moment of action
occurs, there is no need to make a decision. Simply follow your
predetermined plan.
The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill
out this sentence:
I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my
bedroom.
Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.
Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the
kitchen.
If you aren’t sure when to start your habit, try the first day of the
week, month, or year. People are more likely to take action at those
times because hope is usually higher. If we have hope, we have a
reason to take action. A fresh start feels motivating.
There is another benefit to implementation intentions. Being
specific about what you want and how you will achieve it helps you say
no to things that derail progress, distract your attention, and pull you
off course. We often say yes to little requests because we are not clear
enough about what we need to be doing instead. When your dreams
are vague, it’s easy to rationalize little exceptions all day long and never
get around to the specific things you need to do to succeed.
Give your habits a time and a space to live in the world. The goal is
to make the time and location so obvious that, with enough repetition,
you get an urge to do the right thing at the right time, even if you can’t
say why. As the writer Jason Zweig noted, “Obviously you’re never
going to just work out without conscious thought. But like a dog
salivating at a bell, maybe you start to get antsy around the time of day
you normally work out.”
There are many ways to use implementation intentions in your life
and work. My favorite approach is one I learned from Stanford
professor BJ Fogg and it is a strategy I refer to as habit stacking.HABIT STACKING: A SIMPLE PLAN TO OVERHAUL YOUR
HABITS
The French philosopher Denis Diderot lived nearly his entire life in
poverty, but that all changed one day in 1765.
Diderot’s daughter was about to be married and he could not afford
to pay for the wedding. Despite his lack of wealth, Diderot was well
known for his role as the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, one of
the most comprehensive encyclopedias of the time. When Catherine
the Great, the Empress of Russia, heard of Diderot’s financial troubles,
her heart went out to him. She was a book lover and greatly enjoyed his
encyclopedia. She offered to buy Diderot’s personal library for £1,000
—more than $150,000 today.* Suddenly, Diderot had money to spare.
With his new wealth, he not only paid for the wedding but also
acquired a scarlet robe for himself.
Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he
immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by
his more common possessions. He wrote that there was “no more
coordination, no more unity, no more beauty” between his elegant robe
and the rest of his stuff.
Diderot soon felt the urge to upgrade his possessions. He replaced
his rug with one from Damascus. He decorated his home with
expensive sculptures. He bought a mirror to place above the mantel,
and a better kitchen table. He tossed aside his old straw chair for a
leather one. Like falling dominoes, one purchase led to the next.
Diderot’s behavior is not uncommon. In fact, the tendency for one
purchase to lead to another one has a name: the Diderot Effect. The
Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a
spiral of consumption that leads to additional purchases.
You can spot this pattern everywhere. You buy a dress and have to
get new shoes and earrings to match. You buy a couch and suddenly
question the layout of your entire living room. You buy a toy for your
child and soon find yourself purchasing all of the accessories that go
with it. It’s a chain reaction of purchases.
Many human behaviors follow this cycle. You often decide what to
do next based on what you have just finished doing. Going to the
bathroom leads to washing and drying your hands, which reminds you
that you need to put the dirty towels in the laundry, so you add laundrydetergent to the shopping list, and so on. No behavior happens in
isolation. Each action becomes a cue that triggers the next behavior.
Why is this important?
When it comes to building new habits, you can use the
connectedness of behavior to your advantage. One of the best ways to
build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day
and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking.
Habit stacking is a special form of an implementation intention.
Rather than pairing your new habit with a particular time and location,
you pair it with a current habit. This method, which was created by BJ
Fogg as part of his Tiny Habits program, can be used to design an
obvious cue for nearly any habit.*
The habit stacking formula is:
“After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”
For example:
Meditation. After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will
meditate for one minute.
Exercise. After I take off my work shoes, I will immediately
change into my workout clothes.
Gratitude. After I sit down to dinner, I will say one thing I’m
grateful for that happened today.
Marriage. After I get into bed at night, I will give my partner a
kiss.
Safety. After I put on my running shoes, I will text a friend or
family member where I am running and how long it will take.
The key is to tie your desired behavior into something you already
do each day. Once you have mastered this basic structure, you can
begin to create larger stacks by chaining small habits together. This
allows you to take advantage of the natural momentum that comes
from one behavior leading into the next—a positive version of the
Diderot Effect.HABIT STACKING
FIGURE 7: Habit stacking increases the likelihood that you’ll stick with a
habit by stacking your new behavior on top of an old one. This process can
be repeated to chain numerous habits together, each one acting as the cue
for the next.
Your morning routine habit stack might look like this:
1. After I pour my morning cup of coffee, I will meditate for sixty
seconds.
2. After I meditate for sixty seconds, I will write my to-do list for
the day.
3. After I write my to-do list for the day, I will immediately begin
my first task.
Or, consider this habit stack in the evening:1. After I finish eating dinner, I will put my plate directly into the
dishwasher.
2. After I put my dishes away, I will immediately wipe down the
counter.
3. After I wipe down the counter, I will set out my coffee mug for
tomorrow morning.
You can also insert new behaviors into the middle of your current
routines. For example, you may already have a morning routine that
looks like this: Wake up > Make my bed > Take a shower. Let’s say you
want to develop the habit of reading more each night. You can expand
your habit stack and try something like: Wake up > Make my bed >
Place a book on my pillow > Take a shower. Now, when you climb into
bed each night, a book will be sitting there waiting for you to enjoy.
Overall, habit stacking allows you to create a set of simple rules that
guide your future behavior. It’s like you always have a game plan for
which action should come next. Once you get comfortable with this
approach, you can develop general habit stacks to guide you whenever
the situation is appropriate:
Exercise. When I see a set of stairs, I will take them instead of
using the elevator.
Social skills. When I walk into a party, I will introduce myself to
someone I don’t know yet.
Finances. When I want to buy something over $100, I will wait
twenty-four hours before purchasing.
Healthy eating. When I serve myself a meal, I will always put
veggies on my plate first.
Minimalism. When I buy a new item, I will give something away.
(“One in, one out.”)
Mood. When the phone rings, I will take one deep breath and
smile before answering.
Forgetfulness. When I leave a public place, I will check the table
and chairs to make sure I don’t leave anything behind.No matter how you use this strategy, the secret to creating a
successful habit stack is selecting the right cue to kick things off.
Unlike an implementation intention, which specifically states the time
and location for a given behavior, habit stacking implicitly has the time
and location built into it. When and where you choose to insert a habit
into your daily routine can make a big difference. If you’re trying to
add meditation into your morning routine but mornings are chaotic
and your kids keep running into the room, then that may be the wrong
place and time. Consider when you are most likely to be successful.
Don’t ask yourself to do a habit when you’re likely to be occupied with
something else.
Your cue should also have the same frequency as your desired habit.
If you want to do a habit every day, but you stack it on top of a habit
that only happens on Mondays, that’s not a good choice.
One way to find the right trigger for your habit stack is by
brainstorming a list of your current habits. You can use your Habits
Scorecard from the last chapter as a starting point. Alternatively, you
can create a list with two columns. In the first column, write down the
habits you do each day without fail.*
For example:
Get out of bed.
Take a shower.
Brush your teeth.
Get dressed.
Brew a cup of coffee.
Eat breakfast.
Take the kids to school.
Start the work day.
Eat lunch.
End the work day.
Change out of work clothes.
Sit down for dinner.Turn off the lights.
Get into bed.
Your list can be much longer, but you get the idea. In the second
column, write down all of the things that happen to you each day
without fail. For example:
The sun rises.
You get a text message.
The song you are listening to ends.
The sun sets.
Armed with these two lists, you can begin searching for the best
place to layer your new habit into your lifestyle.
Habit stacking works best when the cue is highly specific and
immediately actionable. Many people select cues that are too vague. I
made this mistake myself. When I wanted to start a push-up habit, my
habit stack was “When I take a break for lunch, I will do ten push-ups.”
At first glance, this sounded reasonable. But soon, I realized the trigger
was unclear. Would I do my push-ups before I ate lunch? After I ate
lunch? Where would I do them? After a few inconsistent days, I
changed my habit stack to: “When I close my laptop for lunch, I will do
ten push-ups next to my desk.” Ambiguity gone.
Habits like “read more” or “eat better” are worthy causes, but these
goals do not provide instruction on how and when to act. Be specific
and clear: After I close the door. After I brush my teeth. After I sit
down at the table. The specificity is important. The more tightly bound
your new habit is to a specific cue, the better the odds are that you will
notice when the time comes to act.
The 1st Law of Behavior Change is to make it obvious. Strategies
like implementation intentions and habit stacking are among the most
practical ways to create obvious cues for your habits and design a clear
plan for when and where to take action.

Motivation Is Overrated; Environment
Often Matters More
ANNE THORNDIKE, A primary care physician at Massachusetts General
Hospital in Boston, had a crazy idea. She believed she could improve
the eating habits of thousands of hospital staff and visitors without
changing their willpower or motivation in the slightest way. In fact, she
didn’t plan on talking to them at all.
Thorndike and her colleagues designed a six-month study to alter
the “choice architecture” of the hospital cafeteria. They started by
changing how drinks were arranged in the room. Originally, the
refrigerators located next to the cash registers in the cafeteria were
filled with only soda. The researchers added water as an option to each
one. Additionally, they placed baskets of bottled water next to the food
stations throughout the room. Soda was still in the primary
refrigerators, but water was now available at all drink locations.
Over the next three months, the number of soda sales at the hospital
dropped by 11.4 percent. Meanwhile, sales of bottled water increased
by 25.8 percent. They made similar adjustments—and saw similar
results—with the food in the cafeteria. Nobody had said a word to
anyone eating there.
BEFORE AFTERFIGURE 8: Here is a representation of what the cafeteria looked like before
the environment design changes were made (left) and after (right). The
shaded boxes indicate areas where bottled water was available in each
instance. Because the amount of water in the environment was increased,
behavior shifted naturally and without additional motivation.
People often choose products not because of what they are, but
because of where they are. If I walk into the kitchen and see a plate of
cookies on the counter, I’ll pick up half a dozen and start eating, even if
I hadn’t been thinking about them beforehand and didn’t necessarily
feel hungry. If the communal table at the office is always filled with
doughnuts and bagels, it’s going to be hard not to grab one every now
and then. Your habits change depending on the room you are in and
the cues in front of you.
Environment is the invisible hand that shapes human behavior.
Despite our unique personalities, certain behaviors tend to arise again
and again under certain environmental conditions. In church, people
tend to talk in whispers. On a dark street, people act wary and guarded.
In this way, the most common form of change is not internal, but
external: we are changed by the world around us. Every habit is
context dependent.
In 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that
makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in
their Environment, or B = f (P,E).It didn’t take long for Lewin’s Equation to be tested in business. In
1952, the economist Hawkins Stern described a phenomenon he called
Suggestion Impulse Buying, which “is triggered when a shopper sees a
product for the first time and visualizes a need for it.” In other words,
customers will occasionally buy products not because they want them
but because of how they are presented to them.
For example, items at eye level tend to be purchased more than
those down near the floor. For this reason, you’ll find expensive brand
names featured in easy-to-reach locations on store shelves because
they drive the most profit, while cheaper alternatives are tucked away
in harder-to-reach spots. The same goes for end caps, which are the
units at the end of aisles. End caps are moneymaking machines for
retailers because they are obvious locations that encounter a lot of foot
traffic. For example, 45 percent of Coca-Cola sales come specifically
from end-of-the-aisle racks.
The more obviously available a product or service is, the more likely
you are to try it. People drink Bud Light because it is in every bar and
visit Starbucks because it is on every corner. We like to think that we
are in control. If we choose water over soda, we assume it is because
we wanted to do so. The truth, however, is that many of the actions we
take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the
most obvious option.
Every living being has its own methods for sensing and
understanding the world. Eagles have remarkable long-distance vision.
Snakes can smell by “tasting the air” with their highly sensitive
tongues. Sharks can detect small amounts of electricity and vibrations
in the water caused by nearby fish. Even bacteria have chemoreceptors
—tiny sensory cells that allow them to detect toxic chemicals in their
environment.
In humans, perception is directed by the sensory nervous system.
We perceive the world through sight, sound, smell, touch, and taste.
But we also have other ways of sensing stimuli. Some are conscious,
but many are nonconscious. For instance, you can “notice” when the
temperature drops before a storm, or when the pain in your gut rises
during a stomachache, or when you fall off balance while walking on
rocky ground. Receptors in your body pick up on a wide range of
internal stimuli, such as the amount of salt in your blood or the need to
drink when thirsty.The most powerful of all human sensory abilities, however, is vision.
The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors.
Approximately ten million of those are dedicated to sight. Some
experts estimate that half of the brain’s resources are used on vision.
Given that we are more dependent on vision than on any other sense, it
should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of
our behavior. For this reason, a small change in what you see can lead
to a big shift in what you do. As a result, you can imagine how
important it is to live and work in environments that are filled with
productive cues and devoid of unproductive ones.
Thankfully, there is good news in this respect. You don’t have to be
the victim of your environment. You can also be the architect of it.
HOW TO DESIGN YOUR ENVIRONMENT FOR SUCCESS
During the energy crisis and oil embargo of the 1970s, Dutch
researchers began to pay close attention to the country’s energy usage.
In one suburb near Amsterdam, they found that some homeowners
used 30 percent less energy than their neighbors—despite the homes
being of similar size and getting electricity for the same price.
It turned out the houses in this neighborhood were nearly identical
except for one feature: the location of the electrical meter. Some had
one in the basement. Others had the electrical meter upstairs in the
main hallway. As you may guess, the homes with the meters located in
the main hallway used less electricity. When their energy use was
obvious and easy to track, people changed their behavior.
Every habit is initiated by a cue, and we are more likely to notice
cues that stand out. Unfortunately, the environments where we live
and work often make it easy not to do certain actions because there is
no obvious cue to trigger the behavior. It’s easy not to practice the
guitar when it’s tucked away in the closet. It’s easy not to read a book
when the bookshelf is in the corner of the guest room. It’s easy not to
take your vitamins when they are out of sight in the pantry. When the
cues that spark a habit are subtle or hidden, they are easy to ignore.
By comparison, creating obvious visual cues can draw your
attention toward a desired habit. In the early 1990s, the cleaning staff
at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam installed a small sticker that looked
like a fly near the center of each urinal. Apparently, when men steppedup to the urinals, they aimed for what they thought was a bug. The
stickers improved their aim and significantly reduced “spillage” around
the urinals. Further analysis determined that the stickers cut bathroom
cleaning costs by 8 percent per year.
I’ve experienced the power of obvious cues in my own life. I used to
buy apples from the store, put them in the crisper in the bottom of the
refrigerator, and forget all about them. By the time I remembered, the
apples would have gone bad. I never saw them, so I never ate them.
Eventually, I took my own advice and redesigned my environment. I
bought a large display bowl and placed it in the middle of the kitchen
counter. The next time I bought apples, that was where they went—out
in the open where I could see them. Almost like magic, I began eating a
few apples each day simply because they were obvious rather than out
of sight.
Here are a few ways you can redesign your environment and make
the cues for your preferred habits more obvious:
If you want to remember to take your medication each night, put
your pill bottle directly next to the faucet on the bathroom
counter.
If you want to practice guitar more frequently, place your guitar
stand in the middle of the living room.
If you want to remember to send more thank-you notes, keep a
stack of stationery on your desk.
If you want to drink more water, fill up a few water bottles each
morning and place them in common locations around the house.
If you want to make a habit a big part of your life, make the cue a big
part of your environment. The most persistent behaviors usually have
multiple cues. Consider how many different ways a smoker could be
prompted to pull out a cigarette: driving in the car, seeing a friend
smoke, feeling stressed at work, and so on.
The same strategy can be employed for good habits. By sprinkling
triggers throughout your surroundings, you increase the odds that
you’ll think about your habit throughout the day. Make sure the best
choice is the most obvious one. Making a better decision is easy and
natural when the cues for good habits are right in front of you.Environment design is powerful not only because it influences how
we engage with the world but also because we rarely do it. Most people
live in a world others have created for them. But you can alter the
spaces where you live and work to increase your exposure to positive
cues and reduce your exposure to negative ones. Environment design
allows you to take back control and become the architect of your life.
Be the designer of your world and not merely the consumer of it.
THE CONTEXT IS THE CUE
The cues that trigger a habit can start out very specific, but over time
your habits become associated not with a single trigger but with the
entire context surrounding the behavior.
For example, many people drink more in social situations than they
would ever drink alone. The trigger is rarely a single cue, but rather the
whole situation: watching your friends order drinks, hearing the music
at the bar, seeing the beers on tap.
We mentally assign our habits to the locations in which they occur:
the home, the office, the gym. Each location develops a connection to
certain habits and routines. You establish a particular relationship with
the objects on your desk, the items on your kitchen counter, the things
in your bedroom.
Our behavior is not defined by the objects in the environment but by
our relationship to them. In fact, this is a useful way to think about the
influence of the environment on your behavior. Stop thinking about
your environment as filled with objects. Start thinking about it as filled
with relationships. Think in terms of how you interact with the spaces
around you. For one person, her couch is the place where she reads for
an hour each night. For someone else, the couch is where he watches
television and eats a bowl of ice cream after work. Different people can
have different memories—and thus different habits—associated with
the same place.
The good news? You can train yourself to link a particular habit with
a particular context.
In one study, scientists instructed insomniacs to get into bed only
when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to sit
in a different room until they became sleepy. Over time, subjects beganto associate the context of their bed with the action of sleeping, and it
became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Their
brains learned that sleeping—not browsing on their phones, not
watching television, not staring at the clock—was the only action that
happened in that room.
The power of context also reveals an important strategy: habits can
be easier to change in a new environment. It helps to escape the subtle
triggers and cues that nudge you toward your current habits. Go to a
new place—a different coffee shop, a bench in the park, a corner of
your room you seldom use—and create a new routine there.
It is easier to associate a new habit with a new context than to build
a new habit in the face of competing cues. It can be difficult to go to
bed early if you watch television in your bedroom each night. It can be
hard to study in the living room without getting distracted if that’s
where you always play video games. But when you step outside your
normal environment, you leave your behavioral biases behind. You
aren’t battling old environmental cues, which allows new habits to
form without interruption.
Want to think more creatively? Move to a bigger room, a rooftop
patio, or a building with expansive architecture. Take a break from the
space where you do your daily work, which is also linked to your
current thought patterns.
Trying to eat healthier? It is likely that you shop on autopilot at your
regular supermarket. Try a new grocery store. You may find it easier to
avoid unhealthy food when your brain doesn’t automatically know
where it is located in the store.
When you can’t manage to get to an entirely new environment,
redefine or rearrange your current one. Create a separate space for
work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find
useful is “One space, one use.”
When I started my career as an entrepreneur, I would often work
from my couch or at the kitchen table. In the evenings, I found it very
difficult to stop working. There was no clear division between the end
of work time and the beginning of personal time. Was the kitchen table
my office or the space where I ate meals? Was the couch where I
relaxed or where I sent emails? Everything happened in the same
place.A few years later, I could finally afford to move to a home with a
separate room for my office. Suddenly, work was something that
happened “in here” and personal life was something that happened
“out there.” It was easier for me to turn off the professional side of my
brain when there was a clear dividing line between work life and home
life. Each room had one primary use. The kitchen was for cooking. The
office was for working.
Whenever possible, avoid mixing the context of one habit with
another. When you start mixing contexts, you’ll start mixing habits—
and the easier ones will usually win out. This is one reason why the
versatility of modern technology is both a strength and a weakness.
You can use your phone for all sorts of tasks, which makes it a
powerful device. But when you can use your phone to do nearly
anything, it becomes hard to associate it with one task. You want to be
productive, but you’re also conditioned to browse social media, check
email, and play video games whenever you open your phone. It’s a
mishmash of cues.
You may be thinking, “You don’t understand. I live in New York
City. My apartment is the size of a smartphone. I need each room to
play multiple roles.” Fair enough. If your space is limited, divide your
room into activity zones: a chair for reading, a desk for writing, a table
for eating. You can do the same with your digital spaces. I know a
writer who uses his computer only for writing, his tablet only for
reading, and his phone only for social media and texting. Every habit
should have a home.
If you can manage to stick with this strategy, each context will
become associated with a particular habit and mode of thought. Habits
thrive under predictable circumstances like these. Focus comes
automatically when you are sitting at your work desk. Relaxation is
easier when you are in a space designed for that purpose. Sleep comes
quickly when it is the only thing that happens in your bedroom. If you
want behaviors that are stable and predictable, you need an
environment that is stable and predictable.
A stable environment where everything has a place and a purpose is
an environment where habits can easily form.
Chapter SummarySmall changes in context can lead to large changes in behavior
over time.
Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues
that stand out.
Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
Gradually, your habits become associated not with a single trigger
but with the entire context surrounding the behavior. The context
becomes the cue.
It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you
are not fighting against old cues.7
The Secret to Self-Control
I
N 1971, as the Vietnam War was heading into its sixteenth year,
congressmen Robert Steele from Connecticut and Morgan Murphy
from Illinois made a discovery that stunned the American public.
While visiting the troops, they had learned that over 15 percent of U.S.
soldiers stationed there were heroin addicts. Follow-up research
revealed that 35 percent of service members in Vietnam had tried
heroin and as many as 20 percent were addicted—the problem was
even worse than they had initially thought.
The discovery led to a flurry of activity in Washington, including the
creation of the Special Action Office of Drug Abuse Prevention under
President Nixon to promote prevention and rehabilitation and to track
addicted service members when they returned home.
Lee Robins was one of the researchers in charge. In a finding that
completely upended the accepted beliefs about addiction, Robins
found that when soldiers who had been heroin users returned home,
only 5 percent of them became re-addicted within a year, and just 12
percent relapsed within three years. In other words, approximately
nine out of ten soldiers who used heroin in Vietnam eliminated their
addiction nearly overnight.
This finding contradicted the prevailing view at the time, which
considered heroin addiction to be a permanent and irreversible
condition. Instead, Robins revealed that addictions could
spontaneously dissolve if there was a radical change in the
environment. In Vietnam, soldiers spent all day surrounded by cues
triggering heroin use: it was easy to access, they were engulfed by the
constant stress of war, they built friendships with fellow soldiers whowere also heroin users, and they were thousands of miles from home.
Once a soldier returned to the United States, though, he found himself
in an environment devoid of those triggers. When the context changed,
so did the habit.
Compare this situation to that of a typical drug user. Someone
becomes addicted at home or with friends, goes to a clinic to get clean
—which is devoid of all the environmental stimuli that prompt their
habit—then returns to their old neighborhood with all of their previous
cues that caused them to get addicted in the first place. It’s no wonder
that usually you see numbers that are the exact opposite of those in the
Vietnam study. Typically, 90 percent of heroin users become re-
addicted once they return home from rehab.
The Vietnam studies ran counter to many of our cultural beliefs
about bad habits because it challenged the conventional association of
unhealthy behavior as a moral weakness. If you’re overweight, a
smoker, or an addict, you’ve been told your entire life that it is because
you lack self-control—maybe even that you’re a bad person. The idea
that a little bit of discipline would solve all our problems is deeply
embedded in our culture.
Recent research, however, shows something different. When
scientists analyze people who appear to have tremendous self-control,
it turns out those individuals aren’t all that different from those who
are struggling. Instead, “disciplined” people are better at structuring
their lives in a way that does not require heroic willpower and self-
control. In other words, they spend less time in tempting situations.
The people with the best self-control are typically the ones who need
to use it the least. It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t
have to use it very often. So, yes, perseverance, grit, and willpower are
essential to success, but the way to improve these qualities is not by
wishing you were a more disciplined person, but by creating a more
disciplined environment.
This counterintuitive idea makes even more sense once you
understand what happens when a habit is formed in the brain. A habit
that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used whenever the
relevant situation arises. When Patty Olwell, a therapist from Austin,
Texas, started smoking, she would often light up while riding horses
with a friend. Eventually, she quit smoking and avoided it for years.
She had also stopped riding. Decades later, she hopped on a horseagain and found herself craving a cigarette for the first time in forever.
The cues were still internalized; she just hadn’t been exposed to them
in a long time.
Once a habit has been encoded, the urge to act follows whenever the
environmental cues reappear. This is one reason behavior change
techniques can backfire. Shaming obese people with weight-loss
presentations can make them feel stressed, and as a result many
people return to their favorite coping strategy: overeating. Showing
pictures of blackened lungs to smokers leads to higher levels of
anxiety, which drives many people to reach for a cigarette. If you’re not
careful about cues, you can cause the very behavior you want to stop.
Bad habits are autocatalytic: the process feeds itself. They foster the
feelings they try to numb. You feel bad, so you eat junk food. Because
you eat junk food, you feel bad. Watching television makes you feel
sluggish, so you watch more television because you don’t have the
energy to do anything else. Worrying about your health makes you feel
anxious, which causes you to smoke to ease your anxiety, which makes
your health even worse and soon you’re feeling more anxious. It’s a
downward spiral, a runaway train of bad habits.
Researchers refer to this phenomenon as “cue-induced wanting”: an
external trigger causes a compulsive craving to repeat a bad habit.
Once you notice something, you begin to want it. This process is
happening all the time—often without us realizing it. Scientists have
found that showing addicts a picture of cocaine for just thirty-three
milliseconds stimulates the reward pathway in the brain and sparks
desire. This speed is too fast for the brain to consciously register—the
addicts couldn’t even tell you what they had seen—but they craved the
drug all the same.
Here’s the punch line: You can break a habit, but you’re unlikely to
forget it. Once the mental grooves of habit have been carved into your
brain, they are nearly impossible to remove entirely—even if they go
unused for quite a while. And that means that simply resisting
temptation is an ineffective strategy. It is hard to maintain a Zen
attitude in a life filled with interruptions. It takes too much energy. In
the short-run, you can choose to overpower temptation. In the long-
run, we become a product of the environment that we live in. To put it
bluntly, I have never seen someone consistently stick to positive habits
in a negative environment.A more reliable approach is to cut bad habits off at the source. One
of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to reduce
exposure to the cue that causes it.
If you can’t seem to get any work done, leave your phone in
another room for a few hours.
If you’re continually feeling like you’re not enough, stop following
social media accounts that trigger jealousy and envy.
If you’re wasting too much time watching television, move the TV
out of the bedroom.
If you’re spending too much money on electronics, quit reading
reviews of the latest tech gear.
If you’re playing too many video games, unplug the console and
put it in a closet after each use.
This practice is an inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change.
Rather than make it obvious, you can make it invisible. I’m often
surprised by how effective simple changes like these can be. Remove a
single cue and the entire habit often fades away.
Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one. You may
be able to resist temptation once or twice, but it’s unlikely you can
muster the willpower to override your desires every time. Instead of
summoning a new dose of willpower whenever you want to do the right
thing, your energy would be better spent optimizing your environment.
This is the secret to self-control. Make the cues of your good habits
obvious and the cues of your bad habits invisible.
Chapter Summary
The inversion of the 1st Law of Behavior Change is make it
invisible.
Once a habit is formed, it is unlikely to be forgotten.
People with high self-control tend to spend less time in tempting
situations. It’s easier to avoid temptation than resist it.
One of the most practical ways to eliminate a bad habit is to
reduce exposure to the cue that causes it.

How to Make a Habit Irresistible
I
N THE 1940S, a Dutch scientist named Niko Tinbergen performed a
series of experiments that transformed our understanding of what
motivates us. Tinbergen—who eventually won a Nobel Prize for his
work—was investigating herring gulls, the gray and white birds often
seen flying along the seashores of North America.
Adult herring gulls have a small red dot on their beak, and
Tinbergen noticed that newly hatched chicks would peck this spot
whenever they wanted food. To begin one experiment, he created a
collection of fake cardboard beaks, just a head without a body. When
the parents had flown away, he went over to the nest and offered these
dummy beaks to the chicks. The beaks were obvious fakes, and he
assumed the baby birds would reject them altogether.
However, when the tiny gulls saw the red spot on the cardboard
beak, they pecked away just as if it were attached to their own mother.
They had a clear preference for those red spots—as if they had been
genetically programmed at birth. Soon Tinbergen discovered that the
bigger the red spot, the faster the chicks pecked. Eventually, he created
a beak with three large red dots on it. When he placed it over the nest,
the baby birds went crazy with delight. They pecked at the little red
patches as if it was the greatest beak they had ever seen.
Tinbergen and his colleagues discovered similar behavior in other
animals. For example, the greylag goose is a ground-nesting bird.
Occasionally, as the mother moves around on the nest, one of the eggs
will roll out and settle on the grass nearby. Whenever this happens, the
goose will waddle over to the egg and use its beak and neck to pull it
back into the nest.Tinbergen discovered that the goose will pull any nearby round
object, such as a billiard ball or a lightbulb, back into the nest. The
bigger the object, the greater their response. One goose even made a
tremendous effort to roll a volleyball back and sit on top. Like the baby
gulls automatically pecking at red dots, the greylag goose was following
an instinctive rule: When I see a round object nearby, I must roll it
back into the nest. The bigger the round object, the harder I should try
to get it.
It’s like the brain of each animal is preloaded with certain rules for
behavior, and when it comes across an exaggerated version of that rule,
it lights up like a Christmas tree. Scientists refer to these exaggerated
cues as supernormal stimuli. A supernormal stimulus is a heightened
version of reality—like a beak with three red dots or an egg the size of a
volleyball—and it elicits a stronger response than usual.
Humans are also prone to fall for exaggerated versions of reality.
Junk food, for example, drives our reward systems into a frenzy. After
spending hundreds of thousands of years hunting and foraging for
food in the wild, the human brain has evolved to place a high value on
salt, sugar, and fat. Such foods are often calorie-dense and they were
quite rare when our ancient ancestors were roaming the savannah.
When you don’t know where your next meal is coming from, eating as
much as possible is an excellent strategy for survival.
Today, however, we live in a calorie-rich environment. Food is
abundant, but your brain continues to crave it like it is scarce. Placing
a high value on salt, sugar, and fat is no longer advantageous to our
health, but the craving persists because the brain’s reward centers have
not changed for approximately fifty thousand years. The modern food
industry relies on stretching our Paleolithic instincts beyond their
evolutionary purpose.
A primary goal of food science is to create products that are more
attractive to consumers. Nearly every food in a bag, box, or jar has
been enhanced in some way, if only with additional flavoring.
Companies spend millions of dollars to discover the most satisfying
level of crunch in a potato chip or the perfect amount of fizz in a soda.
Entire departments are dedicated to optimizing how a product feels in
your mouth—a quality known as orosensation. French fries, for
example, are a potent combination—golden brown and crunchy on the
outside, light and smooth on the inside.Other processed foods enhance dynamic contrast, which refers to
items with a combination of sensations, like crunchy and creamy.
Imagine the gooeyness of melted cheese on top of a crispy pizza crust,
or the crunch of an Oreo cookie combined with its smooth center. With
natural, unprocessed foods, you tend to experience the same
sensations over and over—how’s that seventeenth bite of kale taste?
After a few minutes, your brain loses interest and you begin to feel full.
But foods that are high in dynamic contrast keep the experience novel
and interesting, encouraging you to eat more.
Ultimately, such strategies enable food scientists to find the “bliss
point” for each product—the precise combination of salt, sugar, and fat
that excites your brain and keeps you coming back for more. The
result, of course, is that you overeat because hyperpalatable foods are
more attractive to the human brain. As Stephan Guyenet, a
neuroscientist who specializes in eating behavior and obesity, says,
“We’ve gotten too good at pushing our own buttons.”
The modern food industry, and the overeating habits it has
spawned, is just one example of the 2nd Law of Behavior Change:
Make it attractive. The more attractive an opportunity is, the more
likely it is to become habit-forming.
Look around. Society is filled with highly engineered versions of
reality that are more attractive than the world our ancestors evolved in.
Stores feature mannequins with exaggerated hips and breasts to sell
clothes. Social media delivers more “likes” and praise in a few minutes
than we could ever get in the office or at home. Online porn splices
together stimulating scenes at a rate that would be impossible to
replicate in real life. Advertisements are created with a combination of
ideal lighting, professional makeup, and Photoshopped edits—even the
model doesn’t look like the person in the final image. These are the
supernormal stimuli of our modern world. They exaggerate features
that are naturally attractive to us, and our instincts go wild as a result,
driving us into excessive shopping habits, social media habits, porn
habits, eating habits, and many others.
If history serves as a guide, the opportunities of the future will be
more attractive than those of today. The trend is for rewards to become
more concentrated and stimuli to become more enticing. Junk food is a
more concentrated form of calories than natural foods. Hard liquor is a
more concentrated form of alcohol than beer. Video games are a moreconcentrated form of play than board games. Compared to nature,
these pleasure-packed experiences are hard to resist. We have the
brains of our ancestors but temptations they never had to face.
If you want to increase the odds that a behavior will occur, then you
need to make it attractive. Throughout our discussion of the 2nd Law,
our goal is to learn how to make our habits irresistible. While it is not
possible to transform every habit into a supernormal stimulus, we can
make any habit more enticing. To do this, we must start by
understanding what a craving is and how it works.
We begin by examining a biological signature that all habits share—
the dopamine spike.
THE DOPAMINE-DRIVEN FEEDBACK LOOP
Scientists can track the precise moment a craving occurs by measuring
a neurotransmitter called dopamine.* The importance of dopamine
became apparent in 1954 when the neuroscientists James Olds and
Peter Milner ran an experiment that revealed the neurological
processes behind craving and desire. By implanting electrodes in the
brains of rats, the researchers blocked the release of dopamine. To the
surprise of the scientists, the rats lost all will to live. They wouldn’t eat.
They wouldn’t have sex. They didn’t crave anything. Within a few days,
the animals died of thirst.
In follow-up studies, other scientists also inhibited the dopamine-
releasing parts of the brain, but this time, they squirted little droplets
of sugar into the mouths of the dopamine-depleted rats. Their little rat
faces lit up with pleasurable grins from the tasty substance. Even
though dopamine was blocked, they liked the sugar just as much as
before; they just didn’t want it anymore. The ability to experience
pleasure remained, but without dopamine, desire died. And without
desire, action stopped.
When other researchers reversed this process and flooded the
reward system of the brain with dopamine, animals performed habits
at breakneck speed. In one study, mice received a powerful hit of
dopamine each time they poked their nose in a box. Within minutes,
the mice developed a craving so strong they began poking their nose
into the box eight hundred times per hour. (Humans are not sodifferent: the average slot machine player will spin the wheel six
hundred times per hour.)
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. Every behavior that is
highly habit-forming—taking drugs, eating junk food, playing video
games, browsing social media—is associated with higher levels of
dopamine. The same can be said for our most basic habitual behaviors
like eating food, drinking water, having sex, and interacting socially.
For years, scientists assumed dopamine was all about pleasure, but
now we know it plays a central role in many neurological processes,
including motivation, learning and memory, punishment and aversion,
and voluntary movement.
When it comes to habits, the key takeaway is this: dopamine is
released not only when you experience pleasure, but also when you
anticipate it. Gambling addicts have a dopamine spike right before
they place a bet, not after they win. Cocaine addicts get a surge of
dopamine when they see the powder, not after they take it. Whenever
you predict that an opportunity will be rewarding, your levels of
dopamine spike in anticipation. And whenever dopamine rises, so does
your motivation to act.
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets
us to take action.
Interestingly, the reward system that is activated in the brain when
you receive a reward is the same system that is activated when you
anticipate a reward. This is one reason the anticipation of an
experience can often feel better than the attainment of it. As a child,
thinking about Christmas morning can be better than opening the
gifts. As an adult, daydreaming about an upcoming vacation can be
more enjoyable than actually being on vacation. Scientists refer to this
as the difference between “wanting” and “liking.”
THE DOPAMINE SPIKEFIGURE 9: Before a habit is learned (A), dopamine is released when the
reward is experienced for the first time. The next time around (B), dopamine
rises before taking action, immediately after a cue is recognized. This spike
leads to a feeling of desire and a craving to take action whenever the cue is
spotted. Once a habit is learned, dopamine will not rise when a reward is
experienced because you already expect the reward. However, if you see a
cue and expect a reward, but do not get one, then dopamine will drop in
disappointment (C). The sensitivity of the dopamine response can clearly be
seen when a reward is provided late (D). First, the cue is identified and
dopamine rises as a craving builds. Next, a response is taken but the reward
does not come as quickly as expected and dopamine begins to drop. Finally,
when the reward comes a little later than you had hoped, dopamine spikes
again. It is as if the brain is saying, “See! I knew I was right. Don’t forget to
repeat this action next time.”Your brain has far more neural circuitry allocated for wanting
rewards than for liking them. The wanting centers in the brain are
large: the brain stem, the nucleus accumbens, the ventral tegmental
area, the dorsal striatum, the amygdala, and portions of the prefrontal
cortex. By comparison, the liking centers of the brain are much
smaller. They are often referred to as “hedonic hot spots” and are
distributed like tiny islands throughout the brain. For instance,
researchers have found that 100 percent of the nucleus accumbens is
activated during wanting. Meanwhile, only 10 percent of the structure
is activated during liking.
The fact that the brain allocates so much precious space to the
regions responsible for craving and desire provides further evidence of
the crucial role these processes play. Desire is the engine that drives
behavior. Every action is taken because of the anticipation that
precedes it. It is the craving that leads to the response.
These insights reveal the importance of the 2nd Law of Behavior
Change. We need to make our habits attractive because it is the
expectation of a rewarding experience that motivates us to act in the
first place. This is where a strategy known as temptation bundling
comes into play.
HOW TO USE TEMPTATION BUNDLING TO MAKE YOUR HABITS
MORE ATTRACTIVE
Ronan Byrne, an electrical engineering student in Dublin, Ireland,
enjoyed watching Netflix, but he also knew that he should exercise
more often than he did. Putting his engineering skills to use, Byrne
hacked his stationary bike and connected it to his laptop and
television. Then he wrote a computer program that would allow Netflix
to run only if he was cycling at a certain speed. If he slowed down for
too long, whatever show he was watching would pause until he started
pedaling again. He was, in the words of one fan, “eliminating obesity
one Netflix binge at a time.”
He was also employing temptation bundling to make his exercise
habit more attractive. Temptation bundling works by linking an action
you want to do with an action you need to do. In Byrne’s case, he
bundled watching Netflix (the thing he wanted to do) with riding his
stationary bike (the thing he needed to do).Businesses are masters at temptation bundling. For instance, when
the American Broadcasting Company, more commonly known as ABC,
launched its Thursday-night television lineup for the 2014–2015
season, they promoted temptation bundling on a massive scale.
Every Thursday, the company would air three shows created by
screenwriter Shonda Rhimes—Grey’s Anatomy, Scandal, and How to
Get Away with Murder. They branded it as “TGIT on ABC” (TGIT
stands for Thank God It’s Thursday). In addition to promoting the
shows, ABC encouraged viewers to make popcorn, drink red wine, and
enjoy the evening.
Andrew Kubitz, head of scheduling for ABC, described the idea
behind the campaign: “We see Thursday night as a viewership
opportunity, with either couples or women by themselves who want to
sit down and escape and have fun and drink their red wine and have
some popcorn.” The brilliance of this strategy is that ABC was
associating the thing they needed viewers to do (watch their shows)
with activities their viewers already wanted to do (relax, drink wine,
and eat popcorn).
Over time, people began to connect watching ABC with feeling
relaxed and entertained. If you drink red wine and eat popcorn at 8
p.m. every Thursday, then eventually “8 p.m. on Thursday” means
relaxation and entertainment. The reward gets associated with the cue,
and the habit of turning on the television becomes more attractive.
You’re more likely to find a behavior attractive if you get to do one
of your favorite things at the same time. Perhaps you want to hear
about the latest celebrity gossip, but you need to get in shape. Using
temptation bundling, you could only read the tabloids and watch
reality shows at the gym. Maybe you want to get a pedicure, but you
need to clean out your email inbox. Solution: only get a pedicure while
processing overdue work emails.
Temptation bundling is one way to apply a psychology theory
known as Premack’s Principle. Named after the work of professor
David Premack, the principle states that “more probable behaviors will
reinforce less probable behaviors.” In other words, even if you don’t
really want to process overdue work emails, you’ll become conditioned
to do it if it means you get to do something you really want to do along
the way.You can even combine temptation bundling with the habit stacking
strategy we discussed in Chapter 5 to create a set of rules to guide your
behavior.
The habit stacking + temptation bundling formula is:
1. After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [HABIT I NEED].
2. After [HABIT I NEED], I will [HABIT I WANT].
If you want to read the news, but you need to express more
gratitude:
1. After I get my morning coffee, I will say one thing I’m grateful
for that happened yesterday (need).
2. After I say one thing I’m grateful for, I will read the news (want).
If you want to watch sports, but you need to make sales calls:
1. After I get back from my lunch break, I will call three potential
clients (need).
2. After I call three potential clients, I will check ESPN (want).
If you want to check Facebook, but you need to exercise more:
1. After I pull out my phone, I will do ten burpees (need).
2. After I do ten burpees, I will check Facebook (want).
The hope is that eventually you’ll look forward to calling three
clients or doing ten burpees because it means you get to read the latest
sports news or check Facebook. Doing the thing you need to do means
you get to do the thing you want to do.
We began this chapter by discussing supernormal stimuli, which are
heightened versions of reality that increase our desire to take action.
Temptation bundling is one way to create a heightened version of any
habit by connecting it with something you already want. Engineering a
truly irresistible habit is a hard task, but this simple strategy can beemployed to make nearly any habit more attractive than it would be
otherwise.
Chapter Summary
The 2nd Law of Behavior Change is make it attractive.
The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to
become habit-forming.
Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine
rises, so does our motivation to act.
It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that
gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the
dopamine spike.
Temptation bundling is one way to make your habits more
attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an
action you need to do.9
The Role of Family and Friends in Shaping
Your Habits
I
N 1965, a Hungarian man named Laszlo Polgar wrote a series of
strange letters to a woman named Klara.
Laszlo was a firm believer in hard work. In fact, it was all he
believed in: he completely rejected the idea of innate talent. He
claimed that with deliberate practice and the development of good
habits, a child could become a genius in any field. His mantra was “A
genius is not born, but is educated and trained.”
Laszlo believed in this idea so strongly that he wanted to test it with
his own children—and he was writing to Klara because he “needed a
wife willing to jump on board.” Klara was a teacher and, although she
may not have been as adamant as Laszlo, she also believed that with
proper instruction, anyone could advance their skills.
Laszlo decided chess would be a suitable field for the experiment,
and he laid out a plan to raise his children to become chess prodigies.
The kids would be home-schooled, a rarity in Hungary at the time. The
house would be filled with chess books and pictures of famous chess
players. The children would play against each other constantly and
compete in the best tournaments they could find. The family would
keep a meticulous file system of the tournament history of every
competitor the children faced. Their lives would be dedicated to chess.
Laszlo successfully courted Klara, and within a few years, the
Polgars were parents to three young girls: Susan, Sofia, and Judit.
Susan, the oldest, began playing chess when she was four years old.
Within six months, she was defeating adults.Sofia, the middle child, did even better. By fourteen, she was a world
champion, and a few years later, she became a grandmaster.
Judit, the youngest, was the best of all. By age five, she could beat
her father. At twelve, she was the youngest player ever listed among
the top one hundred chess players in the world. At fifteen years and
four months old, she became the youngest grandmaster of all time—
younger than Bobby Fischer, the previous record holder. For twenty-
seven years, she was the number-one-ranked female chess player in
the world.
The childhood of the Polgar sisters was atypical, to say the least.
And yet, if you ask them about it, they claim their lifestyle was
attractive, even enjoyable. In interviews, the sisters talk about their
childhood as entertaining rather than grueling. They loved playing
chess. They couldn’t get enough of it. Once, Laszlo reportedly found
Sofia playing chess in the bathroom in the middle of the night.
Encouraging her to go back to sleep, he said, “Sofia, leave the pieces
alone!” To which she replied, “Daddy, they won’t leave me alone!”
The Polgar sisters grew up in a culture that prioritized chess above
all else—praised them for it, rewarded them for it. In their world, an
obsession with chess was normal. And as we are about to see, whatever
habits are normal in your culture are among the most attractive
behaviors you’ll find.
THE SEDUCTIVE PULL OF SOCIAL NORMS
Humans are herd animals. We want to fit in, to bond with others, and
to earn the respect and approval of our peers. Such inclinations are
essential to our survival. For most of our evolutionary history, our
ancestors lived in tribes. Becoming separated from the tribe—or worse,
being cast out—was a death sentence. “The lone wolf dies, but the pack
survives.”*
Meanwhile, those who collaborated and bonded with others enjoyed
increased safety, mating opportunities, and access to resources. As
Charles Darwin noted, “In the long history of humankind, those who
learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”
As a result, one of the deepest human desires is to belong. And this
ancient preference exerts a powerful influence on our modern
behavior.We don’t choose our earliest habits, we imitate them. We follow the
script handed down by our friends and family, our church or school,
our local community and society at large. Each of these cultures and
groups comes with its own set of expectations and standards—when
and whether to get married, how many children to have, which
holidays to celebrate, how much money to spend on your child’s
birthday party. In many ways, these social norms are the invisible rules
that guide your behavior each day. You’re always keeping them in
mind, even if they are at the not top of your mind. Often, you follow the
habits of your culture without thinking, without questioning, and
sometimes without remembering. As the French philosopher Michel
de Montaigne wrote, “The customs and practices of life in society
sweep us along.”
Most of the time, going along with the group does not feel like a
burden. Everyone wants to belong. If you grow up in a family that
rewards you for your chess skills, playing chess will seem like a very
attractive thing to do. If you work in a job where everyone wears
expensive suits, then you’ll be inclined to splurge on one as well. If all
of your friends are sharing an inside joke or using a new phrase, you’ll
want to do it, too, so they know that you “get it.” Behaviors are
attractive when they help us fit in.
We imitate the habits of three groups in particular:
1. The close.
2. The many.
3. The powerful.
Each group offers an opportunity to leverage the 2nd Law of
Behavior Change and make our habits more attractive.
1. Imitating the Close
Proximity has a powerful effect on our behavior. This is true of the
physical environment, as we discussed in Chapter 6, but it is also true
of the social environment.
We pick up habits from the people around us. We copy the way our
parents handle arguments, the way our peers flirt with one another,the way our coworkers get results. When your friends smoke pot, you
give it a try, too. When your wife has a habit of double-checking that
the door is locked before going to bed, you pick it up as well.
I find that I often imitate the behavior of those around me without
realizing it. In conversation, I’ll automatically assume the body posture
of the other person. In college, I began to talk like my roommates.
When traveling to other countries, I unconsciously imitate the local
accent despite reminding myself to stop.
As a general rule, the closer we are to someone, the more likely we
are to imitate some of their habits. One groundbreaking study tracked
twelve thousand people for thirty-two years and found that “a person’s
chances of becoming obese increased by 57 percent if he or she had a
friend who became obese.” It works the other way, too. Another study
found that if one person in a relationship lost weight, the other partner
would also slim down about one third of the time. Our friends and
family provide a sort of invisible peer pressure that pulls us in their
direction.
Of course, peer pressure is bad only if you’re surrounded by bad
influences. When astronaut Mike Massimino was a graduate student at
MIT, he took a small robotics class. Of the ten people in the class, four
became astronauts. If your goal was to make it into space, then that
room was about the best culture you could ask for. Similarly, one study
found that the higher your best friend’s IQ at age eleven or twelve, the
higher your IQ would be at age fifteen, even after controlling for
natural levels of intelligence. We soak up the qualities and practices of
those around us.
One of the most effective things you can do to build better habits is
to join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.
New habits seem achievable when you see others doing them every
day. If you are surrounded by fit people, you’re more likely to consider
working out to be a common habit. If you’re surrounded by jazz lovers,
you’re more likely to believe it’s reasonable to play jazz every day. Your
culture sets your expectation for what is “normal.” Surround yourself
with people who have the habits you want to have yourself. You’ll rise
together.
To make your habits even more attractive, you can take this strategy
one step further.Join a culture where (1) your desired behavior is the normal
behavior and (2) you already have something in common with the
group. Steve Kamb, an entrepreneur in New York City, runs a company
called Nerd Fitness, which “helps nerds, misfits, and mutants lose
weight, get strong, and get healthy.” His clients include video game
lovers, movie fanatics, and average Joes who want to get in shape.
Many people feel out of place the first time they go to the gym or try to
change their diet, but if you are already similar to the other members
of the group in some way—say, your mutual love of Star Wars—change
becomes more appealing because it feels like something people like
you already do.
Nothing sustains motivation better than belonging to the tribe. It
transforms a personal quest into a shared one. Previously, you were on
your own. Your identity was singular. You are a reader. You are a
musician. You are an athlete. When you join a book club or a band or a
cycling group, your identity becomes linked to those around you.
Growth and change is no longer an individual pursuit. We are readers.
We are musicians. We are cyclists. The shared identity begins to
reinforce your personal identity. This is why remaining part of a group
after achieving a goal is crucial to maintaining your habits. It’s
friendship and community that embed a new identity and help
behaviors last over the long run.
2. Imitating the Many
In the 1950s, psychologist Solomon Asch conducted a series of
experiments that are now taught to legions of undergrads each year. To
begin each experiment, the subject entered the room with a group of
strangers. Unbeknownst to them, the other participants were actors
planted by the researcher and instructed to deliver scripted answers to
certain questions.
The group would be shown one card with a line on it and then a
second card with a series of lines. Each person was asked to select the
line on the second card that was similar in length to the line on the first
card. It was a very simple task. Here is an example of two cards used in
the experiment:
CONFORMING TO SOCIAL NORMSFIGURE 10: This is a representation of two cards used by Solomon Asch in
his famous social conformity experiments. The length of the line on the first
card (left) is obviously the same as line C, but when a group of actors
claimed it was a different length the research subjects would often change
their minds and go with the crowd rather than believe their own eyes.
The experiment always began the same. First, there would be some
easy trials where everyone agreed on the correct line. After a few
rounds, the participants were shown a test that was just as obvious as
the previous ones, except the actors in the room would select an
intentionally incorrect answer. For example, they would respond “A”
to the comparison shown in Figure 10. Everyone would agree that the
lines were the same even though they were clearly different.
The subject, who was unaware of the ruse, would immediately
become bewildered. Their eyes would open wide. They would laugh
nervously to themselves. They would double-check the reactions of
other participants. Their agitation would grow as one person after
another delivered the same incorrect response. Soon, the subject began
to doubt their own eyes. Eventually, they delivered the answer they
knew in their heart to be incorrect.
